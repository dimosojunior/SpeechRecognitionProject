i'm using django and below are my django views codes for translating speech into text and then save into a file called my_speech.txt, until there everything is working correctly.
my codes are;
@login_required(login_url='login')
def speech_recognition(request):
    error_message =None
    

    if request.method == 'POST':

        random.seed()
        random_number = random.randint(1,100)
        print(f"RandomNumber {random_number}")

        username = request.user.username
        email = request.user.email
        microphone_no = 0 #request.POST.get('microphone_no')

        save_speech = SpeechRecognitionHistory.objects.create(username=username, email=email)
        save_speech.save()

        # microphone_no_integer = int(microphone_no)



        


        #START SPEECH RECOGNITION
        import speech_recognition as sr

        r = sr.Recognizer()

        mic = sr.Microphone(device_index=microphone_no)

        print("Start Speaking")
        #error_message = "Start Speaking!!"
        #messages.info(request, f'Hey {username} Start Speaking')


        with mic as source:
            audio = r.listen(source)


        try:
            result = r.recognize_google(audio)
        except sr.RequestError:
            #exit("API is unreachable")
            #error_message = "API is unreachable"
            messages.info(request, f'Hey {username}, Requested API is unreachable')
            return redirect("home")


        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            #exit("Unable to recognize speech! ")
            #error_message = "Unable to recognize speech!"
            messages.info(request, f'Hey {username}, Unable to recognize speech!')
            return redirect("home")


        with open(BASE_DIR+f'\\SpeechHistory\\my_speech.txt',mode='w') as file:
            file.write(result)

        print("It has stored speech into text in my file")
        #error_message = "It has stored speech into text in my file"
        messages.info(request, f'Hey {username}, It has stored speech into text in my file')
        

        # Reading speech from text file
        with open(BASE_DIR+f'\\SpeechHistory\\my_speech.txt', mode='r') as file:
            speech_text = file.read()

        # Printing speech in terminal
        print("Speech from file:")
        print(speech_text)

        # Storing speech in a variable to use later
        request.session['speech_text'] = speech_text




        return redirect("home")

 below are my django model codes;
 class SpeechRecognitionHistory(models.Model):

    username = models.CharField(max_length=200,blank=False,null=False)
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=100,blank=False,null=False)
    # microphone_no = models.CharField(max_length=200,default="0", blank=False,null=False)
    # image = models.ImageField(blank=True,null=True, upload_to="media/")
    speech_files = models.FileField(blank=True,null=True, upload_to="files/")
    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username

So the problem is i have already saved the username and email when speech_recognition function is called as you can see in my views.py codes above, so now problem is in my models also i have a file field called 'speech_files', so the thing i need is, after listening a audio and stores that speech in my_speech.txt file, and then i read again that speech from that file.
last thing i need is to add that file 'my_speech.txt' in my djang model to replace speech_files field and save both fields at the same time in a database which are username, email and speech_files.

 so pass through my codes above and modify them to implement this issue.
